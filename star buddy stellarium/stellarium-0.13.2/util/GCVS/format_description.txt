GCVS part for Stellarium. This file contains part of Hipparcos stars from GCVS.
Format:
+ One record per line
+ Fields in a record are delimited with the tab character
+ Line beginning with a # character are comments
+ Field are as follows:
  - HIP
  - GCVS designation
  - Type of variability
  - Magnitude at maximum brightness
  - Magnitude flag code (0=No flag, 
			 1="(" if magMax is an amplitude,
			 2="<" if magMax is a bright limit, 
                         3=">" if magMax is a faint limit)
  - Minimum magnitude or amplitude
  - The photometric system for magnitudes
  - Epoch for maximum light (Julian days)
  - Period of the variable star (days)
  - Rising time or duration of eclipse (%)
  - Spectral type
