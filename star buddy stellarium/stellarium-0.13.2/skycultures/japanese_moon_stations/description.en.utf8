<h2>Japanese Moon Stations</h2>
<p>Most astronomical observation in the Japan until the Meiji Restoration was closely tied to astrological purposes. 
For ancient Chinese and later Korean and Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions is marked 
as four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), the Red Bird of the South (Summer), the White 
Tiger of the West (Fall), and the "Genbu" (Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each of the 
talismanic animals the celestial "palaces" were seven <em>sei shuku</em> or what are sometimes called "lunar lodges". 
The moon "stations" or "lodges" probably may be used to determine position of sun and planets as well as the moon, 
and their number may or may not have been related to the period of the moon's orbit. Origins of these associations 
are obscure and even controversial.</p>
<p>Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star "palaces" together with the associated 28 <em>sei shuku</em> 
or lunar lodges represent some of the most complex aspects of Asian "astronomy". An apparent anomaly is the fact that the 
actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a direction opposite the seasonal associations of Spring and Fall. 
Some scientists argues that this is due to the animals and sei shuku being created some 17 to 18 millennia ago 
(precession creating the anomaly), but it does not really explain the apparent "backward" motion of the sun through seasons.</p>
<p>According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated sei shuku were probably used in conjunction with 
the direction to which the handle of the big dipper (often called the "North Seven Stars" in China, Korea, and Japan) pointed 
at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the Christian Era, when the sei shuku were created, the big dipper did not 
appear to set, because they had a relatively "higher" position than now. </p>
<p>Like myths and traditions in Western cultures, these views still wield influence in the daily life of people in China, 
Korea, and Japan (this despite quite prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed out that astrological 
divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather complex.</p>
<p>The lore related to moon stations is one of the most interesting aspects of Asian Ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations 
of these associations tended to revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike many Western myths and 
traditions, japanese gods in the similitude of the talismanic animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.</p>
